# LeetCode

Made a leetcode program to automate some things. It is built on top
of a [leetcode-cli](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli). It does some extra things
to work better with my workflow.

Other than that I will be recording a new leetcode session, it will be a mixture of
the languages I am reviewing, hand picked thanks to [colorless](https://github.com/MrColour/colorless).
The different OS'es are run on my machine at the same time thanks to VMware (and a few hacks for a Mac Env).

Previous problems I have solved in the meantime can be found in [this](https://github.com/MrColour/LeetCode/tree/previous) different branch.
