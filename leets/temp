You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 
Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

 
Constraints:


	1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
	jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
	All the characters of jewels are unique.
