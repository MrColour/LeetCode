* Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'

We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

Example 1:


<<<<<<< HEAD
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].
=======
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15

Example 2:


<<<<<<< HEAD
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,3]
=======
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 19

Constraints:


<<<<<<< HEAD
	2 <= nums.length <= 100
	nums.length % 2 == 0
	1 <= nums[i] <= 100


=======
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
	1 <= Node.val <= 100
